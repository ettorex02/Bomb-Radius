# Bomb-Radius
A simple tool in C that help you with misurations for cylindric flash powder bombs. 

It's main functionality is to calculate the volume of a cilindre given the radius and the height, after that the program calculate
the total grams of flash powder that the cylinder with V volume can contain.

It's composed by a men√π with 3 entries:
1. You insert the radius and the height and the program will give youthe grams of powder.
2. You give only the radius and the program will calculate the grams of powder with a range of height from 1 to 20 cm.
3. You give only the height and the program will calculate the grams of powder with a range of radius from 1 to 10 cm.

Obviously the program is only a beta and it's for my personal use, so i don't think it will be updated.
